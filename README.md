#Face Dazzler for Web
Face Dazzler for Web is a solo project I conceived and built using Node, Express, jQuery and the trackingjs facial detection library.

The app makes use of a facial detection Javascript library, allowing users to play with facial detection technology in real time. Included are tips and examples of how to thwart facial detection algorithms – in real life and online – including stylized overlays you can drag-and-drop which will "break" the algorithm's ability to find a face. The app also allows users to upload a photo locally and immediately see whether a face is detected. The concept for this app draws heavily from the work of others in the data privacy community, particularly Adam Harvey's CV Dazzle (https://cvdazzle.com/). I am particularly proud of this project because it helps demystify the technology and in a small way puts a degree of power and choice back into people's hands.

The app is deployed on Heroku (https://face-dazzler.herokuapp.com).
